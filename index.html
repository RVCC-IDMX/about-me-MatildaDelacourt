    <h2>Biography:</h2>
    <div>
        <p class="p-style">About me:</p>

        <p>I am from Paraguay, all my life I have worked with computers and just pretty much have always been interested in Programming and Computer Science. 
            I grew up with a family that already had a computer business called Cyber Home which was a computer/Internet cafe where people would come to use the computers or get help with anything technology related. 
            Since I was 8 years old I always wanted to be part of it and always helped out with the business, taught people how to use a computer, how to use a computer safely, inserting your information and keeping it secure. 
            I came to the United States to accomplish my dream and better myself everyday in the technology field and also as a person and in life. 
            This is something I have wanted since i have recollection and I have fought every day to accomplish this dream no matter the obstacles.
        
        <p class="p-style">In my free time:</p>

        <p>I usually play the drums and try to learn new beats, dance moves or I am singing a song I like. 
            These things really help me express myself in different ways and even helps me to be more patient with myself and keep practicing which keeps me consistent.
            When I am not doing one of those things I usually go out and kayak to get some fresh air and get some exercise going.
            Web development is something I really enjoy and have fun doing and is one of my favorite things to do and just want to keep growing every day.</p>

    <h2>Variable Fonts</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Variable fonts enables many different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file instead of having a separate font file for every width, weight or style. You can access all the variations contained in a given font file through CSS and a single @font-face reference.</p>
        <p class="bold">Standard or Static Fonts</p>
        <p>In the past if you haven’t used variable fonts you would have separate files for each individual fonts and what that font would represent like a specific width/weight/style combination. There would be a separate file for the font you were using like the name of the font such as: “Roboto Regular”, “Roboto Bold” and “Roboto Bold Italic”. This means that you would end up with 20 or 30 different font files to represent a complete typeface or even more.</p>

        <p>With Variable fonts all styles can be contained in a single file and you can use CSS to access all the styles contained in a single font file without any worries about browser distortions. This is way more convenient than having a cluster of files just for you fonts. The advantage of choosing the variable font is that you have access to the entire range of weight, widths and styles which helps to design your site better, like changing the headings in different weights for readability or using a slightly narrower width for data-dense displays.</p>
        <p class="bold">Variation Axis</p>
        <p>Axis of variation describes the allowable range of the particular aspect of the typeface design. The weight axis describes how light or how bold the letterforms can be; The width axis describes how narrow or how wide they can be; the italic axis describes if italic letterforms are present and can be turned on or off accordingly.
        An axis can be a range or a binary choice. Weight can range to 1-999 and Italic might be 0 or 1 (off or on).</p>
    <section id="vFont1">
        <image src="images/RobotoItalic-900.png" alt= "Variable font."></image>
        <image src="images/code1.png" alt= "Variable font code."></image>
    </section>
        <p>As defined in the specification, there are two kind of axes: registered and custom:</p>

        <p>Registered axes are those that are most frequently encountered and common enough that the authors of the specification felt it was worth standardizing. The five currently registered axes are weight, width, slant, italic and optical size.</p> 

        <p>Custom axes are limitless: the typeface designer can define and scope any axis they like and are just required to give it a four-letter tag to identify it within the font file for format itself. You can use these four-letter tags in CSS to specify a point along that axis of variation.</p>
