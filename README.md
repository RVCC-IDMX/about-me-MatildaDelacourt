# Description
#### AboutMe is a website that helps you get to know me better and see what I am up to.
#### For this project I have used HTML and CSS styling. 
#### For the first part of this project I have added images, links and colors that have good contrast for background and text. I tried to make it as accessible as possible. 
#### You will be able to see my photo gallery, a blog about me and a short video.
#### I have used breakpoints & media queries so there is a good responsive design as well as using grid and flex to change the layout for accessibility.
#### At the very end you will be able to see a contact form in case you would like to send me any message or comment with your information (optional).
#### There is a nav-bar that can link to different parts of the page so anything you are looking for can be easily found.
#### I have created a logo with Adobe and set it as a favicon.
#### Along with the photo gallery there is a profile picture of me a description of my hobbies and some information about me in my bio.
#### I have added a hover effect to the photo gallery as well as a good transition for the images.
#### The research topic i decided on was variable fonts, where in the blog area i give information about how it works and how it used to work, as well as some example screenshots of how to use the font-variation-settings with a four letter word and how to change the weight.
#### I've connected all this to Netlify where the website is displayed.
