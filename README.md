# About Me Description
AboutMe is a website that helps you get to know me better and see what I am up to.
For this project I have used HTML and CSS styling. 
For the first part of this project I have added images, links and colors that have good contrast for background and text. I tried to make it as accessible as possible. 
You will be able to see my photo gallery, a blog about me and a short video.
I have used breakpoints & media queries so there is a good responsive design as well as using grid and flex to change the layout for accessibility.
At the very end you will be able to see a contact form in case you would like to send me any message or comment with your information (optional).
There is a nav-bar that can link to different parts of the page so anything you are looking for can be easily found.
I've connected all this to Netlify where the website is displayed.
